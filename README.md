# What's happenning today?
The purpose of this project is to create a news classifier as well as perform some NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks. Some practical cases have been done in order to use our model. The project is divided in 3 main blocks:

The first block is dedicated to the train and analysis of the model:
- 1_Classifier.ipynb

The second block is about the use of our model with real news:
- 2_NLP_part_1.ipynb
- 3_NLP_part_2.ipynb

The third block is about the interface which was created in DASH, enabling a friendly use of the code:
- 4_Dash_framework_part_1.ipynb
- 5_Dash_framework_part_2.ipynb
